This section will cover the fundamentals and the basics into javascript.

## Description: 
As I have done with the video lecture previous to this assessment here. I will watch the video lectures, perform the skills that we are working with in that section to both use and understand what we are doing. During the video lecture I will take my own notes that will help to recall any information that we are working on. 
Let's Begin.

13. Create further content within the html, this will be the list to follow. Create our first few lines of script on our own.
14. Create the first portion of javascript for the js stalker excercise. Starting with the variables.
15. Create the second portion of javascript for the js stalker. Ending with the console.log to print the input in the console.
16. Condense code, How we can create more beautifully written code making things look cleaner in our js file. 
17. Test and run that the javascript that we have written works with our lading page.
18. Start watching the next content of video lectures. The next excercise to follow will be the age calculator.
19. Comment out the first section and the first excercise. Clear the canvas for the second excercise.
20. Create the first line of javascript code for the second excercise. Test and run. 
21. Create the full script to build what will be the age calculator and have the solution show as an alert.
22. Complete the second section and complete the second excercise.
23. Pick up where the video lecture left off. Perform a review of content. 
24. Watch the video lecture to review the openeing section on the content for javascript.
25. Begin watching new video lecture content. Overview of boolean logic statments.
26. Begin video lecture for the use of operators and the the main concept of conditional statements.
27. Clear/ Comment out the code that we have create for the first and the second code along sections.
28. Set up the files to begin creating a new small excercise code along to follow the video lectures.
29. Create a number guessing game for the user when the landing page opens up. Start with setting up the html file.
30. Next, create the script to perorm those tasks. We will start with setting our variables.
31. After we have created the variables we will need to assign a method to interp. the data.
32. Test and run the script that we have created. All works as it should within the browser.
33. We will now create a step further for the number game, to create the code that will check if the number is lower or higher than the users guess.
34. Let's begin in this continued section. Create a further step to the guessing game within the js files.
35. Create the comments next to each step for better understanding for what each step is performing. 
36. Test and run all the script code that we have created. All working as the code should.
37. Introduction of loops, what they are and how they work. The full understanding of loops.
38. Understanding while loops, the concept and the how they work. 
39. Comment out the html file and the js file that we currently have set within learning files. Set up to perform the next excercise
40. Create all while loops that will assign to each of the problems notated in the landing page within the html file.
41. Test and run all the code that we have created within our script file to perform the problems within shown in the file.
42. Perform the code along to create while loops using strings rather than using numbers.
43. Create the code within the js file to perform the code along for the while loops with strings excercise.
44. Understanding how to use the index of call to show that the key word is within the string.
45. Test and run that all code is currently working as designed.
